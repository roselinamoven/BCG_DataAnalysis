# PowerCo Customer Churn Analysis

PowerCo, a major gas and electricity utility, is concerned about losing customers. This project aims to investigate whether price sensitivity is a significant factor influencing customer churn and utilizes various frameworks to conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) and predictive modeling.

## Project Overview

This repository contains the analysis of client data to understand customer churn dynamics and to explore how price sensitivity impacts churn. The project leverages Python for data analysis and visualization, feature engineering to test hypotheses, and predictive modeling to assess churn risk.

## What I will  Do

### 1. **Data Analysis and Visualization**
- **Analyze Client Data**: Use Python to process and analyze client data, identifying key trends and patterns.
- **Create Data Visualizations**: Generate visualizations to interpret data and highlight significant insights.

### 2. **Feature Engineering**
- **Hypothesis Testing**: Employ feature engineering techniques to test hypotheses about factors affecting churn.
- **Feature Building**: Develop new features to enrich the dataset and enhance analysis.

### 3. **Predictive Modeling**
- **Build Predictive Model**: Create a churn prediction model using the Random Forest technique.
- **Model Evaluation**: Assess the model's performance and its ability to predict churn risk.

### 4. **Communication of Insights**
- **Executive Summary**: Write a comprehensive summary of findings, including key insights and recommendations based on the analysis and modeling.

## Frameworks and Tools

- **Python**: Primary programming language for data analysis and visualization.
- **Pandas and NumPy**: For data manipulation and numerical operations.
- **Scikit-learn**: For building and evaluating predictive models.
- **Matplotlib and Seaborn**: For creating visualizations.
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: To document the analysis process and results.
